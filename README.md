# SPI Protocol

Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is one of the most widely used interfaces between microcontroller and peripheral ICs such as sensors, ADCs, DACs, shift registers, SRAM, and others.


## Abstract
This repository has managed by writing System Verilog based testbench architecture for SPI Protocol, for further exploring on verification concept's, let's build another verification environment buy another framework like UVM, cocotb, e(Specman Elite) etc...

##  Open Source Software's
 **EDA Playground**:
 EDA Playground gives engineers immediate hands-on exposure to simulating and synthesizing SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, C++/SystemC, and other HDLs. All you need is a web browser.
